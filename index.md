## OVERVIEW

The WESOA series of workshops addresses challenges that arise from unique characteristics of service-oriented applications by focusing on principles, methodologies and tools that support the entire service-oriented software development lifecycle.

Topics of interest include software service development lifecycle methodologies, service-oriented enterprise architectures, service engineering for cloud computing environments, models, languages and methods for service-oriented analysis and design, and related topics.

WESOA 2015 continues a successful series of [ICSOC](http://www.icsoc.org) workshops. Over the past decade, WESOA has demonstrated its relevance by attracting a large number of contributors and participants from academia as well as industry, and producing high-quality papers that were published by Springer LNCS series.

## OBJECTIVES

Service-oriented applications play an important role in many areas like enterprise computing, cloud computing and the web. While there is an agreement about the main principles for designing and developing such applications, methodologies and tools that support the development of service-oriented applications are still a subject of intensive research.

It is recognized that traditional software engineering approaches require extensions in the context of service-oriented computing and that there is a need for engineering methods to support the development of software services (incl. microservices). In this area, close collaboration between the research community and industry practitioners is essential to develop comprehensive engineering methodologies and tools that support the entire lifecycle of service-oriented applications.

WESOA complements [ICSOC](http://www.icsoc.org) by focusing on core software engineering issues in the context of service-oriented systems, keeping pace with emerging application areas of service computing such mobile, social, cloud computing, smart environments and IoT.
